# remote_code_execution_discord_bot
A discord bot that once set up and running allows you to execute commands through discord

To use this script you have to change the valid_users in the python file to the people you want to be able to use the command.

Then you have to put your client id at the bottom of the python file inside the () where it says client id

Then you have to change the path to the files in the bash script to the correct path on your computer.

Finally you just run the rce.py and the rce.sh scripts

Also I don't love that the bash script is checking the pythonoutput.txt file every 0.1 seconds so if anyone has a better way of doing it please tell me.
